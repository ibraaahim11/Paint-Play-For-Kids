<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## <a id="about-the-project"></a>About The Project

Paint & Play For Kids is a fun and interactive C++ application designed to help children learn and recognize shapes and colors through drawing and playful challenges. The app provides two main modes: Draw Mode and Play Mode. Kids can freely create, edit, and manage shapes, then switch to playful mini-games that reinforce their understanding of shapes and colors. The project aims to make learning enjoyable and engaging for young users.
